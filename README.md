# Welcome to ClubMedAI: NYU Langone Club for Medical AI 


Our goal is to create a virtual club to discuss the latest developments in the field of AI in medicine.
This will be a participant-driven journal club and we will cover papers in form of lightning talks and deep dive and discussion. 
All NYU affiliates are welcome. It will be fun!

We are planning a regular meeting every other Friday, with the **first session: Friday, February 19th, 2021 11 am - noon Eastern**  

### Tentative meeting format (Open to feedback)
1. Multiple (6) lightining talks, each for about 5 minutes, covering diverse and relevant papers.
2. Remaining half of the session allocated to a deep dive and discussion period.
3. We will also add a short segment on cool grants (if any) within the related area.

We strongly encourage departments to each take over the sessions, champion talks from researchers within their groups, and be part of the leadership of this club.
