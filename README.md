# Welcome to ClubMedAI: NYU Langone Club for Medical AI 

Our goal is to create a virtual club to discuss the latest developments in the field of AI in medicine.
This will be a participant-driven journal club and we will cover papers in form of lightning talks and deep dive and discussion. 
All NYU affiliates are welcome. It will be fun!

We meet every other Friday 11am-noon. 
For calendar invite reach out to narges.razavian@nyulangone.org
